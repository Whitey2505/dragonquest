# dragonquest
can't remember where I picked this up
couple of minor tweaks for clarity on the display

dragon hides in one of ten caves.
pick a cave, throw your spear and decide on the response
whether to collect your spear and choose a new cave

the dragon can move one cave in either direction after each throw.
get too close and you get munched!
